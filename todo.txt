TODO list
----------------------------------------------
Next release:

Buff bar

Battletext

Option for vsync
Option for fixed 2x scaling
Option for fullscreen (with alt enter too)
Option for borderless window

Maybe decouple loading from framerate somehow? Or at least maybe load more per frame

Drop items from inventory
Tab support for login screen

Fix:
