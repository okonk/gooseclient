Future to complete client compatibility:

Tooltip for items on ground? Or should I do that with the other "item on ground" stuff?
Fix tint colour rendering
Fix textboxes to scroll properly
Chat input history with up/down arrows in chatbox
Right click show item stats (this is a generic window, so things like ranks will auto work too)
Vendor windows
Combine bag window
Button bar window
Melee
Fix window draw order so active window draws on top
Remember window positions
AD4 Warr sword renders too high. Spells render too high. Wonder if both of these problems are related

Future future extended things:

Server browser (or at least a server selection screen from saved servers)
